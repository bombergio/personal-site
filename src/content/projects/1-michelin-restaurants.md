After a few Michelin-starred restaurants we were interested in collecting all the pictures, bill info and our evaluation in one place.
A first-world problem, I know ðŸ˜ƒ.

At the same time, Astro came out with version 1.0, and I decided to give it a try and do some front-end development after a long break.

This project is built using [Astro](https://astro.build), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and hosting on Cloudflare Pages. Airtable is used as a CMS, and n8n is used for a sprinkle of automation.
Images are hosted in imagekit.io. Mapbox is used as a replacement for Google Maps.
Lastly, a slightly modified https://github.com/ngshiheng/michelin-my-maps repo is used to scrape the Michelin homepage for all restaurants to add to statistics.
